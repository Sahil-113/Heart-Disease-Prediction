# Heart Disease Prediction Model
# Overview
This project involves the development of a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of heart disease in individuals based on clinical and demographic data. By leveraging advanced algorithms and data preprocessing techniques, the model provides an effective tool for early detection of heart disease.

# Features
